          Dolphins are known for being smart, playful creatures that can learn
          to perform impressive tricks. But you might not know that dolphins are
          also champion nappers who have helped the U.S. Navy protect nuclear
          warheads.

        <p>
          Dolphins have smooth, rubbery skin and are usually colored in some
          mixture of black, white, and gray. They have two flippers, or fins, on
          their sides, as well as a triangular fin on the back. Like other
          whales, they have an insulating layer of blubber (fat) beneath the
          skin.
